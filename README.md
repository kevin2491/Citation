Citation Analysis using BERT

In this research, I have used SciBERT and Bert base uncased for multiclass text classification, I managed to achieve a macro F1 score of 64% with the SciBERT Model and Macro F1 Score of 60% with Bert base uncased. I then performed data augmentation to check if it helps improve the accuracy. With the Data Augmentation I managed to achieve a Macro F1 Score of 91% accuracy with both the SciBERT Model and the Bert base uncased Model.
